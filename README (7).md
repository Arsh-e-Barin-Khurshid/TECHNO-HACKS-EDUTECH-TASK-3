# **Currency Converter**
## 1. Project Overview

The Currency Converter Application is a user-friendly tool designed to help users convert amounts from one currency to another in real time. Using a graphical interface built with tkinter and enhanced with the Pillow library for background images, the application provides a visually appealing experience. This project is ideal for users looking to quickly and accurately determine currency exchange values using up-to-date rates.




## 2. Key Features

This application comes with several key features, including support for multiple currencies, a user-friendly interface, and the ability to clear inputs for new conversions. It supports popular global currencies such as USD, EUR, and GBP, as well as regional currencies like PKR (Pakistan Rupee), AED (UAE Dirham), and SAR (Saudi Riyal). The clear button functionality allows users to reset the form easily, enabling efficient handling of multiple conversions.


## 3. System Requirements

To run the Currency Converter Application, you need Python 3.x installed on your system. Additionally, it requires specific Python libraries, including tkinter (which is included with Python by default), Pillow for handling images, and requests for fetching real-time exchange rate data. Ensure your Python environment is up to date to avoid compatibility issues.








## 4. Installation Guide

Setting up the Currency Converter Application is straightforward. First, clone the repository from the provided GitHub link. Next, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. Ensure that all required packages are installed, including Pillow and requests, to guarantee that the application functions correctly.






## 5. Running the Application

Once installation is complete, the application can be run from the command line using python currency-converter.py. Upon launching, the application displays a welcome screen. Users can start the conversion process by clicking the "Start Conversion" button, which takes them to the main conversion screen where they can input amounts and select currencies.



## 6. User Interface and Experience

The application interface is designed to be both aesthetically pleasing and easy to use. A high-resolution background image related to currency is used to enhance the visual appeal without compromising the readability of the content. The interface is intuitive, with dropdown menus for selecting currencies and clearly labeled buttons for actions like converting amounts and clearing inputs.




## 7. Supported Currencies

This application supports a wide range of currencies, making it versatile for international users. It includes major global currencies such as the US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), and British Pound (GBP), as well as regional currencies like the Pakistani Rupee (PKR), UAE Dirham (AED), and Saudi Riyal (SAR). This variety ensures users from different countries can use the converter for their specific needs.




## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

Common issues include problems with internet connectivity, which can prevent the application from fetching real-time exchange rates. Users should check their internet connection if they encounter errors. Additionally, the background image must be correctly named and placed in the same directory as the script to avoid issues with image loading. These simple checks can resolve most problems that users may encounter.



## 9. Future Enhancements

Future versions of the Currency Converter Application could include additional features such as historical exchange rate data, the ability to save conversion history, and more customizable user interface options. Expanding the number of supported currencies and improving the accuracy of conversion rates by using multiple data sources could further enhance the application's utility and appeal.
